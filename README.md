# EE4685 - Assignment 2 - Bitcoin Price Prediction

In Assignment 2, you are asked to develop machine learning algorithms for a specific task, e.g., prediction of Bitcoin prices, and critically assess those algorithms from various perspectives.

## Specifications

The specifications are as follows:

- Development of ML algorithms: you are expected to implement and compare non-Bayesian and Bayesian approaches, and discuss the pros and cons of each approach.
Below is a list of projects that you can choose from. 
- You are expected to work in groups of 2. Therefore, please sign up for a project as a group of 2.
- The deliverables are as follows:
  - Python code and documentation in Jupyter notebooks  (the code needs to work!)
    - This can be provided as an ipynb file, a link to a colab page or a link to a Github page.
  - 10-page single-column report (excluding references) + Turnitin similarity report (similarity needs to be less than 10%)
  - 10-min video recording, summarizing the project
- To be submitted by Fri 24 March 2023 midnight
- Assignment 2 contributes 35% of the total grade.

## Suggestions for report and presentation

We suggest the following flow for the project report and video presentation:

- Introduction of the problem (what are you trying to solve?)
- Motivation (why is it an important problem?)
- Proposed methodology (How are you trying to solve the problem?)
  - explanation of datasets, training procedures, models, cross-validation, assessment metrics
- Results (What scores did the algorithms achieve?)
  - Tables and figures with metrics, e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-scores, MSE, computational complexity, memory requirements
- Discussion (What do the various scores tell us? What other aspects are important?)
  - Compare the results of the algorithms that you have implemented
  - Compare also with algorithms proposed in the literature
  - Elaborate on the pros and cons of the different approaches (consider here not only technical aspects, but also broader issues such as quality control, ethics, biases, privacy).
- Conclusions (wrap-up and outlook for the future)
  - Brief summary of results
  - Suggest ideas for future research
- References from the literature (in the video, references can be listed in the footnotes on the slides)

## Peer Review

- Each group of 2 students is asked to assess two projects from their peers; for conducting those peer reviews, the students can obtain a maximum of 7% of the total grade. 
- In each peer review, the students are advised to include 3 strengths of the project, 3 weaknesses of the project (areas for improvement), and suggest a few ideas for future explorations.

## Assessment

Assignment 2 will be assessed according to a variety of criteria:

- originality and complexity of the ML approaches,
- correctness of the results and rigor in the analysis,
- depth of the analysis and discussion,
- quality of the writing and presentation,
- readability and quality of the Python code.

## Suggestions

- We have created a thread on the forum for this assignment. We recommend the students to discuss your projects with your peers and instructors.
- We recommend the students to discuss their project with the instructor(s) on Google Meet, at least once during the course period. The students can book a timeslot for this purpose.
